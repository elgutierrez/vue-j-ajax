# vue-ajax
vue-ajax is a simple vuejs plugin which wraps jQuery AJAX calls up and sends any data in the form data format.

vue-ajax also has the following features:-

* an easy fileupload AJAX function that links into reactive data for complete control on exposing fileupload progress

* an object to form data conversion function done on the fly internally so all you have to do is supply parameters by an object

**Note:** vue-ajax requires you to have already loaded jQuery before using the library.
